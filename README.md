Resource Wall
=========

## Description

This is our midterm project for Lighthouse Labs. Here, we generated our own functional resource wall site in which users can save learning resources (e.g., tutorials, blogs, and videos) to share with others.  


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo into your own local machine
2. Update the .env with your own preferred information
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
  - Optional: run the files in the db folder for some example resources
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
